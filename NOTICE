13) LOG4J

log4j is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of output targets.
In case of problems with an application, it is helpful to enable logging so that the problem
can be located. With log4j it is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the
application binary. The log4j package is designed so that log statements can remain in
shipped code without incurring a high performance cost. It follows that the speed of logging
(or rather not logging) is capital.

LOG4J is released under the Apache License v2.0. The Apache License v2.0 file is provided
with the GeOxygene distribution (see file APACHE-LICENSE-2.0).

The "log4j-1.2.15.jar" file of the Geoxygene distribution is the version 1.2.15 of
LOG4J distribution.
