ABOUT THIS README FILE:

data is the default output subdirectory for the Geographic Java classes generated by the GeOxygene platform. 
The default package assigned to theses classes is geoxygene.geodata.

In order this directory not to be pruned when GeOxygene is checked out from CVS (because it is empty), this 
README file has been created.
