GeOxygene 1.1
2006/06/12

- Compilation of the project without Oracle librairies is now possible:

	* Some classes have been moved in the "datatools" package.
	* Calls to Oracle algorithms in GM_Object have been disabled.
	* A new ant task named "compile-without-oracle" has been created.

- Improvment of the method GeoDatabase::loadAllFeatures for PostGIS 
  (loading all the features contained in a geometry is now supported). 

- PostGIS and Oracle can (and must) share the same XML mapping files. 
  JDBC type is 'STRUCT' and the field conversion class is "fr.ign.cogit.geoxygene.datatools.ojb.GeomGeOxygene2Dbms".
  Examples of mapping files have been modified.

- Support of Postgis 1.0.x ! Compatibility with the previous versions of PostGIS is broken.

- Generation of primary key column "COGITID" on geospatial tables in PostGIS is now possible 
  (use the "Manage Data" item in the Console menu).

- Deletion of an explicit call to the TABLESPACE in the code of OracleSpatialQuery::spatialIndex.

- Correction of errors in the sql scripts for PostGIS.

- Correction of errors in the sql scripts for Oracle. 
  (Since Oracle 10g, it is not possible to insert a null value in diminfo column of USER_SDO_GEOM_METADATA).

- A problem in the ant build file has been fixed (images and property files were not copied in the class folder).
