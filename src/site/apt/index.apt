Introduction

  GeOxygene aims at providing an open framework which implements
  {{{http://www.opengeospatial.org/}OGC}}/{{{http://www.isotc211.org/}ISO}} specifications for the
  development and deployment of geographic (GIS) applications.
  It is a open source contribution of the {{{http://recherche.ign.fr/cogit/}COGIT laboratory}} at the
  {{{http://www.ign.fr/}IGN}} (Institut GÃ©ographique National), the French National Mapping Agency.
  It is released under the terms of the {{{http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/lgpl.html#SEC1}LGPL (GNU Lesser General Public License) license}}.

  GeOxygene is based on Java and open source technologies and provides users with an extensible
  object data model (geographic features, geometry, topology and metadata) which implements
  OGC specifications and ISO standards in the geographic information domain.
  The support of the Java interfaces developped by the open source
  {{{http://geoapi.sourceforge.net/}GeoAPI project}} is planned.

  Data are stored in a relational DBMS (RDBMS) to ensure a rapid and reliable access to the system
  but users do not have to worry about any SQL statements: they model their applications in UML and code in Java.
  Mapping between object and relational environments is performed with open source software.
  At present, {{{http://db.apache.org/ojb/}OJB}} is supported and the mapping files for the storage of
  geographic information in {{{http://www.oracle.com/}Oracle}} or {{{http://postgis.refractions.net/}PostGIS}}
  are provided to users.

News

    * January, 2013 - <<Version 1.5 released>>
    
      This new version includes : 
      
      * a new semiology module with a legend model detailed {{{./semiology.html}here}}
      
      * a new 3D module provides a dedicated GUI mapping tool that is optimized to manipulate 3D geometry, to import special format like CityGML, postgis 3D, ...,
        to use objects and algorithms dedicated to 3D 

      * a new generalization module provides generalization algorithms, spatial analysis api (Multi-criteria decision analysis, ...), 
        methods for calculating compactness, curves, congestion
        
      * data matching process using theory of Evidence
      
    Technically, the project has adopted a new multi-module Maven architecture.
